## The course
In this repository you can find the homework reports and code of the lab for the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning course. In this course, taught at the University of Amsterdam for the master AI programme, we attempt to better understand the workings of different kinds of logics such as propositional logic and Answer Set Programming. We make use of multiple logical reasoning algorithms such as DPLL and CDCL (see the image above). For the final project we solve a logical planning problem using answer set programming in CLINGO, the results of which can be seen in the homework 3 notebook.
